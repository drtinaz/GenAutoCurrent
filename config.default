[DeratingConstants]
# The ambient temperature (in Fahrenheit) at which the generator output begins to be derated.
BaseTemperatureThresholdF = 77.0

# The multiplier for derating above the base temperature.
# Example: For 6% derating per 10Â°F, the coefficient is 0.06 / 10 = 0.006.
TempCoefficient = 0.006

# The multiplier for derating per foot above sea level.
# Example: For 3% derating per 1000 ft, the coefficient is 0.03 / 1000 = 0.00003.
AltitudeCoefficient = 0.00003

# The rated output capacity of the generator at sea level, in amps.
BaseGeneratorOutputAmps = 62.5

# A buffer to prevent the generator from operating at its absolute maximum calculated output.
# To limit the output to 90% of the calculated capacity, set this to 0.9.
OutputBuffer = 0.9

# The generator temperature (in Fahrenheit) at which to apply the high temperature reduction.
HighGenTempThresholdF = 220.0

# The generator temperature (in Fahrenheit) at which to apply the medium temperature reduction.
MediumGenTempThresholdF = 212.0

# The percentage (in decimal form) to reduce the output by when the high temperature threshold is reached.
HighGenTempReduction = 0.85

# The percentage (in decimal form) to reduce the output by when the medium temperature threshold is reached.
MediumGenTempReduction = 0.90

[DefaultSensorValues]
# These values are used if a required sensor (GPS, Temperature) is not found.
# Default altitude in feet to use when the GPS service is unavailable.
DefaultAltitudeFeet = 1000.0

# Default generator temperature in Fahrenheit to use when the sensor is unavailable.
DefaultGeneratorTempF = 180.0

# Default outdoor temperature in Fahrenheit to use when the sensor is unavailable.
DefaultOutdoorTempF = 77.0
